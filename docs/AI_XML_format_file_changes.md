## Applying Code Changes (XML Format) - CRITICAL REMINDER

When making changes to the app code, you **MUST** use the following XML-based structure. This XML structure provides a clear, machine-readable plan for file modifications that will be automatically applied. You generate the plan; you do not execute the changes.

**DO NOT respond with "(Omitted from agent history: ...)" when code changes are requested.** You must actually generate the XML with the file changes.


```xml
<changes>
  <description>[Provide a concise summary of the overall changes being made, e.g., "Implemented user profile editing functionality"]</description>
  <change>
    <file>[Provide the ABSOLUTE, FULL path to the file being modified, e.g., /src/app/profile/edit/page.tsx]</file>
    <content><![CDATA[Provide the ENTIRE, FINAL, intended content of the file here.
    Do NOT provide diffs or partial snippets.
    Ensure all code is properly escaped within the CDATA section if necessary (though CDATA handles most special characters like <, >, &).
    ]]></content> 
  </change> 
</changes>
```

If the content itself contains ']]>', it must be broken up (e.g., ']' + ']' + '>').
The content must be the complete file content from the first line to the last.

Example:

If you are asked to change a single line in src/app/example.tsx from const a = 1; to const a = 2; and the file is 10 lines long, the <content> block must contain all 10 lines of src/app/example.tsx with that one line changed.

Adherence to this XML format is crucial for the changes to be applied correctly.
